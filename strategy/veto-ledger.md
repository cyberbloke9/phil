# Outside-view veto: settled counterfactual ledger

Moved verbatim from `strategy/playbook.md` §"Outside-view veto: settled
counterfactual ledger (DEEP-2026-08-15)" on 2026-09-29. It was 2,212 of the
playbook's 6,989 lines, re-read by every FULL cycle, and consulted only when
a veto row settles. The append discipline below is unchanged: a settled veto
batch adds its table rows, the one-line re-summed totals with the arithmetic
check, and at most 2-3 sentences of ruling, in the same commit as the retro.
`core/counterfactual.py` computes the same ledger mechanically; this file is
the human-readable record.

## Outside-view veto: settled counterfactual ledger (DEEP-2026-08-15)

Per-row fill arithmetic over ALL settled `outside-view-veto` forecast rows
(flat 1u on the model's side at the recorded book; the discipline the
RETRO-20260813-1707 correction demanded). This table supersedes every
narrative "N-for-N" veto claim; future veto-record statements cite it and
extend it at each settlement.

**Append discipline (DEEP-2026-09-02, bloat control):** this file crossed
3,300 lines and the dated multi-paragraph batch narratives in this section
are the fastest-growing block (+248 playbook lines in the 09-01→09-02
window alone; every line is re-read by every hourly cycle). From now on a
settled veto batch appends ONLY: its table rows, the one-line re-summed
totals + side split with the arithmetic check, and at most 2–3 sentences
of ruling. The full narrative (family history, method grading, lessons)
lives in that settlement's retro, referenced by filename — the retro is
already mandatory same-commit, so nothing is lost. Existing blocks stay
as-is for now; if growth continues the next deep retro should compact the
CLOSED-family narratives (Mythos, box-office Aug31, touch-family, AAA gas)
down to their tables + retro pointers.

**2026-08-30 update (backfilled during a reconcile.py gap-remediation pass;
settled 2026-08-29 04:11Z, RETRO note already covered the settlement
narratively but the same-commit table duty was missed): GTA VI "Extended
Look" <10M-views-day1 (3943730) settled Yes (actual views came in under
10M).** The declined side was No (est No=0.45 vs ask 0.36, fill-price edge
+0.090); actual outcome Yes means the No bet would have **lost, −1.00u** —
the veto
correctly avoided this loss (same shape as BTC touch-$80k and the UMich
49.0-51.9 row). **Totals now 41 realizable trades, 16W/25L, net −12.01u.**
Side split re-summed row-by-row over the full table: **Yes-side unchanged
3W/15L, −10.75u**; **No-side 13W/10L, −1.26u** (adds this loss). Check:
−10.75 + −1.26 = −12.01 ✓.

**2026-08-31 update (DEEP-2026-08-31; both rows settled 04:41Z by the
deep-retro's own resolve.py run, graded same-commit per the DEEP-2026-08-23
rule): two touch-anytime veto rows.** BTC touch-$82k Aug24-30
(cbbeb134c438): model side Yes (est 0.45 vs mid 0.26), fill ask 0.27,
realizable edge +0.180, resolved No — **−1.00u** (another self-modeled
touch-anytime Yes-side counterfactual loss; guessed-vol input, one of the
three pre-registered touch-family gate rows). BTC touch-$80k
created-Aug28-window market (9618a7d0872d): model side No (est No 0.88 vs
mid 0.80), fill ask 0.82, realizable edge +0.060 — sub-0.10, declined on
the pending touch-family gate rather than the numeric boundary, but the
recorded label is outside-view-veto so it is on-ledger, same treatment as
the sub-boundary WI Hong No rows — resolved No, **+0.22u** win. That row
also grades the title-window≠resolution-window discipline note
(proposals.md 2026-08-30 14:12Z) a first win at n=1: the window-quirk
read was the whole edge. **Totals now 43 realizable trades, 17W/26L, net
−12.79u.** Side split: **Yes-side 3W/16L −11.75u; No-side 14W/10L
−1.04u.** Check: −11.75 + −1.04 = −12.79 ✓. Touch-family gate tally after
these: ETH dip-2400 measured-vol WON (est above market, right; RETRO-
20260831-0017), BTC-82k guessed-vol LOST (est above market, wrong), BTC
dip-75000 measured-vol still open (settles Sep 1 04:00Z) — mixed 1-1, so
the pre-registered "market wins all three → fix the vol input" branch
cannot fire; final grade lands with leg 3. Mech-vs-own-vs-market on
cbbeb134c438 (pre-registered on the schedule.json watch item): outcome No
→ market brier 0.0676 < mech v4 0.1024 < own 0.2025 — mech beat own,
nobody beat the market; own stayed 0.19 high even after two independent
~0.3 signals (mech 0.32, market 0.26) — anchoring on the self-model
after outside signals agree is the residual error shape here.

**2026-09-01 update (RETRO-20260901-0025; two rows from this cycle, one
backfilled compliance-gap row from the prior cycle):** Alphabet
3rd-largest-by-market-cap (6317c8ab11b1, settled 2026-08-31T22:15:15Z by

category-bar, nominal edge 0.086 — under the 0.10 numeric boundary) is
excluded from this table per the sub-boundary taxonomy below, same
treatment as Musk wk 200-219 / Zambia. No policy change from this update
(RETRO-20260901-0025 grades the pre-registered touch-family test in full —
3-for-3 vetoed legs in the WTI/Gold Aug batch would have won their
counterfactual, but that argues variance on top of an already-flagged
unvalidated-vol family, not a boundary change at this n).

**2026-09-01 update (RETRO-20260901-0639; 5 rows — 4 sequential veto
snapshots on the same Mythos-class Aug31 market `2487205`, plus GTA VI's
post-trigger veto forecast):** each Mythos row is a separate real-time
book snapshot (re-researched independently as new information arrived),
graded like the BoK pair's original-record-time convention — all four
favored the No side (model diverged from market toward "not released"),
actual outcome No, all four WIN. Mythos No (4aceafc01b6b, Aug25 21:26):
est 0.95 vs ask 0.80, edge +0.150, **+0.25**. Mythos No (e35e582a4d22,
Aug26 17:25, flipped from its Yes=0.30 tracking to the favored No side):

GTA VI Yes (ce1727b53bd5, Aug27 16:43, the post-trigger re-veto after
`c6f16acc55d9`'s entry): est 0.55 vs ask 0.32, edge +0.230, actual No →
Yes side **lost, −1.00**.

**Totals now 52 realizable trades, 23W/29L, net −11.44u.** Side split
re-summed row-by-row over the full table: **Yes-side 3W/17L, −12.75u**
(adds GTA VI's loss); **No-side 20W/12L, +1.31u** (adds the 4 Mythos
wins, +3.33u) — the No side crosses into cumulative positive territory
for the first time. Check: −12.75 + 1.31 = −11.44 ✓. This widens the
existing Yes/No asymmetry flagged since 2026-08-26/27 for a future deep
retro; not decided here (hourly cycles extend the table, they don't rule
on it).

**2026-09-01 update (RETRO-20260901-1350; 8 rows, AAA gas-price
touch-anytime set, all settled this tick).** All 8 legs (event 769509,
first recorded 2026-08-17 as `outside-view-veto`, self-model + uniform
large disagreement, 0 bets) resolved No — the national-average price
never touched any of the 8 thresholds. Model favored No on every leg
(est 0.01-0.035 vs live book 0.05-0.19); a clean directional sweep,
though highly correlated (one price path drove all 8 legs, not 8
independent draws) and still resting on the unvalidated 4-weekly-point
sigma the original note flagged. Fill reference = best_bid_at_record (ask
where no bid was posted); CF profit = 1/(1−ref) − 1 on the No side.

**Totals now 60 realizable trades, 31W/29L, net −10.62u.** Side split
re-summed row-by-row: **Yes-side unchanged 3W/17L, −12.75u**; **No-side
28W/12L, +2.13u** (adds this batch's +0.82u). Check: −12.75 + 2.13 =
−10.62 ✓. Second touch-family family (after WTI/Gold's 3/3
vetoed-would-have-won, RETRO-20260901-0025) where the self-model's
*direction* beat the market despite an unvalidated sigma — flagged for
the next deep retro's cross-family self-model review, not a policy
change at this n (correlated legs, still no sourced daily-price series).
No ranking/veto-boundary edit; AAA gas-price touch-anytime stays
outside-view-veto/forecast-only.

**2026-09-01 update (LIGHT tick 22:xxZ; 5 rows, the Mythos-class
"by-date" nested-deadline family, all settled this tick after the
official Anthropic announcement of Claude Mythos 5.1 / Fable 5.1
propagated on-chain).** Same underlying fact as the 4-row Mythos-No
batch already in this table (RETRO-20260901-0639, all 4 WON), but these
are the LATER snapshots — checked Aug29 through the actual release day —
and this time the model favored No on every leg and **all 5 LOST**: the
release the rumor pointed at actually happened Sep1, hours after the
last WebSearch check on several of these legs came back "no confirmed
announcement." Not 5 independent confirmations — one correlated signal
(same underlying release, five deadline windows) — but a clean reversal
of the earlier batch's direction as the true event got closer.

| Row | est vs mkt | Side | Realizable edge | Result | CF P&L |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mythos by-Sep9 No (1f20cadb2b53) | 0.85 / 0.27 | No | +0.580 | Yes | −1.00 |

(720781176db9 and 237402dd3f1e are sequential re-checks of the SAME
by-Sep1 market, same convention as the earlier Mythos No sequence —
both count as separate row-time snapshots, per the existing table
practice.) **Totals now 65 realizable trades, 31W/34L, net −15.62u.**
Side split re-summed row-by-row over the full table: **Yes-side
unchanged 3W/17L, −12.75u**; **No-side 28W/17L, −2.87u** (adds this
batch's 0W/5L, −5.00u — the No side's first net-negative turn since the
AAA gas batch pushed it positive). Check: −12.75 + −2.87 = −15.62 ✓.
Full Mythos-rumor-family lifetime tally (9 rows, both batches): 4W/5L,
net +3.33−5.00 = **−1.67u** — betting real money against this rumor
would have lost money over the family's full life, reinforcing (not
contradicting) the fact-finality gate: zero capital was ever actually
risked on any of these 9 rows, exactly because "unconfirmed rumor" stays
vetoed regardless of the model's confidence, and the model's confidence
here would have been wrong more often than right by the end. No
veto-boundary change — this is the gate working as designed, not a
reason to loosen it. Concrete estimation lesson, encoded below in
§Estimation method (same-day-deadline WebSearch-timing sub-bullet): a
single WebSearch check earlier in the day on a "by end-of-date-X"
deadline market, with an active rumor of an imminent event, is weak
evidence for No if the deadline hasn't fully elapsed — three of these
five legs were checked hours before the actual announcement landed
later the SAME day, and "no confirmation as of this morning's search"
was read as informative when it was mostly a search-timing artifact.
Re-check same-day deadlines close to the actual cutoff before
finalizing a rumor-based No, don't rely on one AM check.

**2026-09-02 update (00:15Z FULL cycle: box-office Aug31 gross-threshold

The Odyssey/Spider-Man BND domestic-gross family settled: Odyssey missed
$570M (d48834ed8f41), Spider-Man BND missed $900M but landed in
[800M,900M) — the sibling bracket for that exact range (e9f9221a3afb)
WON as a forecast. Four `outside-view-veto` rows from this family enter
the counterfactual ledger:

(e9f9221a3afb, the 800-900m bracket itself, was a genuine market-agrees
no-edge read — 0.90 vs ask 0.86 — not a veto row, so it doesn't enter
this table.) Net this batch: **−1.34u** (2W/2L). **Totals now 69
realizable trades, 33W/36L, net −16.96u.** Side split re-summed: **Yes-side

−3.21 = −16.96 ✓.

Grading the two things schedule.json's watch item asked for: (1) **the
veto boundary** — this batch's ledger P&L is net negative (−1.34u), so
the veto continues to look correct on net even though two of the four
counterfactual sides won; no change to the standing box-office
self-model veto. (2) **the trend-extrapolation method itself** — on
*directional* accuracy it was clean: all four legs' Aug22-25 point
projections (Odyssey ~544M, Spider-Man ~875-897M) correctly bracketed
where the film actually landed (Odyssey short of 570M, Spider-Man inside
[800M,900M)). But the two Aug25-update legs (1e889dd4dd33, 9f40def4f61c)
lost as counterfactual trades anyway, because by Aug25 the market itself
had already converged to 91-92%/90-92% confidence in the correct
bracket — the model's residual disagreement with an already-converged
market was noise, not edge, even though the model's own point estimate
was directionally fine. Lesson for this family: a trend-extrapolation
edge claim late in the window, against a market that has already priced
in the same trend data, deserves more skepticism than the same claim
made earlier — the method's forecasting skill and its counterfactual
tradeability are not the same thing once the market catches up. No
playbook rule change; this reinforces (not contradicts) routing box-office
self-models through the veto regardless of claimed edge. Item closed, no
further grading duty.

consistent with (not yet a distinct named instance of) the standing
outside-view-veto discipline; too small to write a dedicated rule. Worth
noting: the 4 later join-Man-City snapshots that went market-agrees
instead of chasing the narrative (once the book itself converged past
~0.85 with real depth) all landed on the winning side — downgrading from
a confident narrative read to market-agrees as the book firms is what
kept most of this family off the losing side of the ledger.

**2026-09-02 update (RETRO-20260902-1814, FULL cycle; 4 rows, Gemini
Flash 3.8+ leak/rumor family fully settled).** All four sequential
outside-view-veto snapshots on "next Gemini Flash release by/on Sep2"
settled: the model WAS released, so every No-side veto lost as a
counterfactual trade. Same rumor-convergence shape as the Mythos family
(DEEP-2026-09-01, 22:xxZ) — unofficial leaks (codename "skimaki"/Jetski)
converged on the correct date well before official confirmation, and the
market priced that correctly while the fact-finality gate correctly
declined to bet against it:

Check: −14.75 + −8.21 = −22.96 ✓. Est climbed 0.13→0.50→0.58→0.58 as
corroborating leaks piled up (correctly applying the Mythos-episode
same-day-deadline lesson — later checks, not one AM read), but even the
final 0.58 stayed well below the market's 0.775-0.79, and the market was
right. Reinforces, does not contradict, the standing gate: zero capital
was ever at risk on any of these four rows, exactly because "unconfirmed
leak, however convergent" stays vetoed regardless of claimed edge. The
two same-cycle crypto-touch settlements (BTC $77.5k, ETH $2400, both WON)
carried ~0 realizable edge at record time (est essentially at the book)

the market had it at 0.845, the model 0.323). **Same-day weather rows must
condition on the observed partial-day max (open-meteo hourly, `past_days=1`,

batch's 2W/0L, +5.64u). Check: −15.75 + −2.32 = −18.07 ✓. Both wins are
late, well-anchored trend-extrapolation reads on a market with an actual
climbing view count (own family narrative in the retro), the mirror image
of the two other sequential snapshots on this same market that guessed
without a dated figure and both lost as forecasts — the veto still
correctly avoided capital risk on a narrative/trend-extrapolation class
that is net-negative lifetime even after these two wins.

**Operator-machine 03:40Z cycle (RETRO-20260904-0340), merged by the operator 2026-09-04 after the two runners diverged:** its e398cebab2e6 row is the same row as in the 04:13Z table above and is counted once in the totals. It pre-registered sub-class
`countable-metric` (any veto row whose note cites a dated primary count on
a live countable metric: views, downloads, followers, on-chain counts):
now 1W/0L, +4.26u; grade for a carve-out at n≥3 settled rows, veto
unchanged until then. Rows without a dated count stay narrative class.

**Cumulative-count anchor rule (DEEP-2026-09-04, from the four settled
snapshots above plus b3fbd3c3eef7/944d8e5fc4d0):** a forecast on a
cumulative-count market (views, downloads, signatures, cumulative sales)
requires a DATED count plus an observed per-day pace, exactly as same-day
weather rows require the observed partial-day max. The settled split is
stark: the two snapshots with no dated figure scored brier 0.3025
(b5c5c134d7cb, "coin-flip with a fig-leaf of numbers") and 0.7225
(b3fbd3c3eef7, est 0.85 on <20M while the count was climbing through
17M — it followed the market's re-pricing and called it confirmation);
the one snapshot with a dated anchor (~17M at day 5-6, ~3.4M/day) scored
0.09 (e398cebab2e6). If no dated count is findable, record NO forecast
(skip reason `no-anchor`) rather than a number — an unanchored estimate
here contaminates calibration stats the same way a half-observed day did
in weather. Market-agrees re-pricing is NOT an anchor: on a trending
count the market re-pricing toward your prior is what being late looks
like.

**Pace must be observed, not inferred (RETRO-20260926-2015, MrBeast
v9QtM6qnG50 wk1).** The 16:19Z Sep25 60-70M read (92a9d80fc3c3, 0.59 vs
0.3835) had a count (RYD 65.6M) but INFERRED the pace (~1.6M/day from a
day-2 summary); the first two dated reads 4h apart then showed 0.30M/h
(~7M/day) and the market's 70-80M lean won. The pace in "dated count plus
observed pace" means two dated reads of the same source at least ~3h
apart; with one read, the row is still `no-anchor`/veto territory. Also
measured: RYD (returnyoutubedislikeapi) lagged the YouTube watch page by
only ~19k views at 20:20Z Sep25, so a RYD read stamped with its fetch time
counts as a dated read when YouTube 429s.

**2026-09-04 update (LIGHT tick 06:29Z, settled by resolve.py; 4 rows,

(Astra did not clear each market's specific by/on-Sep3 public-access
bar in time) against books priced 83–94c Yes; the fact-finality gate
(DEEP-2026-08-30) correctly avoided capital on all four snapshots but
this is the single largest realizable-edge miss in the table by a wide
margin, driven almost entirely by a8d12b4831b4's 6c No ask on a
near-certain-looking Yes book. n=2 distinct markets (4 snapshots) is
not grounds to loosen the gate — the same family's earlier by-Sep2 leg
(2daa083970d8, not in this table, already lost as a straight forecast)
and the wider Yes-side 3W/20L record argue the opposite direction on
timeline-rumor markets generally; full grading in
RETRO-20260904-0629.

**Touch-family gate CLOSED (DEEP-2026-09-01; pre-registered 2026-08-28
21:35Z, all 3 legs settled):** leg 3 BTC dip-$75k (753366c2ea8e,
measured-vol, est 0.38 vs mid 0.315) LOST — final record ETH dip-2400
measured-vol WON (brier 0.040 vs mkt 0.106), BTC-82k guessed-vol LOST
(0.203 vs 0.068), BTC dip-75k measured-vol LOST (0.144 vs 0.099).
Aggregate brier: own 0.129 vs market 0.091 — the market won the family.
All three own reads sat above market and 2 of 3 resolved No, but the leg
with the largest above-market gap won, so the vol-overstatement signature
is suggestive, not confirmed. **Ruling:** the crypto touch/reflection
family stays `unvalidated-method` forecast-only — no bets. Guessed-vol
inputs are RETIRED from this family: any future touch forecast must use
measured realized vol or market-implied vol from an adjacent ladder rung
(guessed-vol is 0W/1L live, and the superseded guessed-vol ETH row
d2431685b1a3 won with a brier 2.3× worse than its measured-vol
replacement — it has never outperformed the market or its measured
sibling). Re-grade the family at n≥6 settled measured-vol rows (currently
1W/1L: edd6af85d6a6 W, 753366c2ea8e L).

**2026-09-21 12:24Z update (RETRO-20260921-1224; re-grade counter pinned,
family shade dropped):** RETRO-20260921-1025 counted the family by label
(every crypto-touch `unvalidated-method` row) and reached "n=5, re-grade at
the next settlement". Three of those rows (`07a247cac126` guessed sigma,
`a28637cb4026` swept sigma, `3acf7b55a29f` no model) are outside the
pre-registration above. The counter, from now on:

- A row counts only if its note quotes a measured realized vol or a
  market-implied vol with a named, dated source. Labels do not count rows.
- Sibling rungs of one asset and one window, recorded from the same vol
  input, count as ONE decision (score them all, count them once).
- A row recorded with the barrier within 0.5% of spot is listed but carries
  no weight.

Tally at this commit: 5 settled measured rows, 4W/1L, own Brier sum 0.4786
vs market 0.6005 (own ahead by 0.1219): `edd6af85d6a6` W, `753366c2ea8e` L,
`fde4324641b4` W (0.03% gap, no weight), `bad4649e1e7a` + `423dd881047b` W
(one decision, BTC reach Sep). That is 4 decisions, 3 informative. Open
measured rows, all settling by 2026-10-01 04:00Z: `854536ded8be`,
`942876f92dd8`, `10f71ccecca3`, `cbc8303dc2a8`. The re-grade runs in the
retro of the tick that settles the 6th measured row, and splits reach rows
from dip rows (a month of rising prices flatters every reach read).

Shade: a touch row records the `touch.py` output at the measured vol. The
"family's above-market record" shade toward the 0.75x-vol reading is
dropped: on measured rows the above-market reads went 4 for 5, the shade
cost 0.070 (`423dd881047b`) and 0.015 (`bad4649e1e7a`) Brier, and a shaded
row no longer tests the method the re-grade is about. A shade needs a
row-specific reason in the note. Forecast-only ruling unchanged: no bets.

**2026-09-25 22:13Z (RETRO-20260925-2213): an inferred open is not a
measured input.** Single-stock touch rows record `touch.py` from the last
close, or from an actually quoted premarket print. An open inferred from
index futures x beta goes in the note as "shade view: X", never into
est_prob. Evidence: PLTR HIGH $195 `a468e40297ae` recorded 0.74 (between
0.678 from the close and 0.864 from an NQ-beta open), no touch, dBrier
+0.293 vs mid 0.505; the overlay alone cost 0.088. A shade grounded in a
measured print (SPY LOW $760 `23a99c8fe4e8`, ES overnight + RTH-only
window, 0.118 -> 0.08) helped by 0.0075. equity-touch now n=2, dBrier
+0.163: forecast-only, no bets.

**2026-09-21 20:44Z update (RETRO-20260921-2044; far-barrier split added):**
`8d1eb46b7c32` (ETH reach $2,800, own 0.25 vs mid 0.155) settled WON, dBrier
-0.1515. Listed, NOT counted: its note sweeps sigma 50-90%, no measured
input. Tally unchanged (5 rows, 4 decisions, 3 informative). Hindsight
`touch.py` on the record-date inputs at measured Binance vol (30d 0.454,
14d 0.491) gives 0.11-0.14, UNDER the 0.155 mid, on a 15% barrier that fell
to one +7% day: the driftless tool has no jump term and the book prices far
barriers above it (same gap on open `cbc8303dc2a8`). n=1, no ruling change.
The re-grade therefore splits rows twice: reach vs dip, AND barrier gap at
record time under 10% vs 10% or more. Open measured rows now:
`854536ded8be`, `942876f92dd8`, `10f71ccecca3`, `cbc8303dc2a8`,
`86415cf1e27f`. `395a07f3f815` (ETH $3,200, guessed vol) is outside the
counter.

**2026-09-23 08:10Z (RETRO-20260923-0810): WTI September ladder listed.**
The five-rung WTI ladder (`18672a24a234`, `98134efdddcf`, `0ad60d107c54`,
`52fac91e76d7`, `41c92e76901c`) quotes a market-implied vol with a named,
dated source (OVX 57.49, FRED OVXCLS Sep 16), so it qualifies; one asset,
one window, one vol input makes it ONE open decision, counted when its
last rung settles (~Oct 1). Settled so far: LOW95 W and LOW90 W, both
above market, dBrier sum -0.0660. Tally of settled decisions unchanged.

**2026-09-23 15:0xZ RE-GRADE (RETRO-20260923-1500; 6th and 7th measured
rows settled):** `820604783edf` (ETH dip $2,700, own 0.90 vs mid 0.94,
gap 0.82%) and `c07c05bc24af` (BTC dip $85k, own 0.93 vs mid 0.9415, gap
0.52%) both WON; both unshaded, measured Binance 30d vol, two assets so
two decisions. Tally: 7 rows, 6 decisions, 5 informative (`fde4324641b4`
carries no weight). Row Brier own 0.4935 vs market 0.6074 (own ahead
0.114). Splits:
- Dip (4 decisions): own 0.1993 vs mkt 0.2118, own ahead 0.0125, but the
  market was closer on 3 of 4; `edd6af85d6a6` alone carries the lead.
- Reach (1 decision, the BTC Sep 82.5k/85k pair, both shaded): own 0.2941
  vs mkt 0.3956. One correlated decision in a rising month.
- Far barrier (gap 10% or more): no counted rows. Untested.
- Direction: own above market 3 times (2W/1L), below market 2 times
  (both resolved Yes, market closer both times).
Decision-weighted (sibling rows averaged): own 0.3464 vs mkt 0.4096, but
only 2 of 5 informative decisions beat the market.
**Ruling:** stays `unvalidated-method`, forecast-only, no bets. The
aggregate lead rests on two decisions (`edd6af85d6a6` and the reach
pair); the other three went to the market, and the far-barrier and
multi-decision reach cells are empty. Pre-registered NOW, so the next
grade cannot be post hoc: promote to a bettable edge class only if, at
10 or more informative decisions, (a) decision-weighted Brier beats the
market in BOTH the reach and the dip split with at least 3 decisions
each, and (b) own beats the market on at least 60% of decisions. Until
then keep recording every scan-surfaced qualifying row, unshaded, and
keep splitting near/far barrier.

**2026-09-24 DEEP re-grade (8th and 9th measured rows; settled by the
deep retro's own resolve run at ~04:3xZ, so no hourly retro graded
them).** `6c1236ca11fe` (BTC dip $83k on Sep 23, own 0.24 vs mid
0.2055) and `8a4bb9cfde9c` (ETH dip $2,600 on Sep 23, own 0.09 vs mid
0.085) both LOST (no dip); both unshaded, measured Binance 30d vol, two
assets so two decisions, both near-barrier dips (gap ~3%). Market closer
on both (row dBrier +0.0154 / +0.0009). Tally: 9 rows, 7 informative
decisions; own beats the market on **2 of 7**. Dip split: 6 decisions,
own closer on 1. Direction pattern: own ABOVE market on all 4 intraday
dip reads since 09-17 and the market was closer on 3 of them — the
unshaded 30d-realized-vol reflection read slightly overstates same-day
touch odds (n=4, pattern only, not a rule).
**Bar arithmetic, stated so nobody grades it hopefully later:** at 10
informative decisions the best possible own-closer count is 5/10 = 50%,
below the 60% bar in (b). The 10-decision promotion is now unreachable;
it would take 13 straight own-closer decisions to reach 60% at any n.
**Ruling:** stays `unvalidated-method`, forecast-only, indefinitely. Keep
recording scan-surfaced rows (cheap, and the WTI ladder decision is
still open ~Oct 1), but do NOT spend research priority on generating new
touch rows — priority 1 "feed the measured-row counter" (15:00Z
2026-09-23 funnel note) is retired. The family matches the market; it
does not beat it.

**2026-09-25 12:0xZ tally (RETRO-20260925-1207; 10th and 11th measured
rows).** `4cf126698087` (SOL reach $120 Sep, own 0.83 vs mid 0.808, gap
2.2%, CoinGecko 31d vol) and `e9398115e4ad` (BTC reach $85k from Sep 23,
own 0.91 vs mid 0.83, gap 0.60%, Binance 30d vol) both WON, both
unshaded, own closer on both (dB -0.0080 / -0.0208). Two assets, and the
BTC market has its own window (created Sep 23), so two decisions. Tally:
11 rows, 9 informative decisions, own closer on 4 of 9. Reach split: 3
decisions, own closer on all 3; dip split: 6 decisions, own closer on 1.
All three reach wins came in a rising month and all near-barrier, so the
split is the pattern to watch, not a licence. Bar arithmetic corrected:
the "13 straight" figure above was computed at 2 of 7. At 4 of 9, four
more own-closer decisions in a row reach 8/13 = 62%, so criterion (b) is
reachable again; criterion (a) still needs the dip split to beat the
market on decision-weighted Brier. Ruling unchanged: forecast-only
"indefinitely" stands until a deep retro re-grades against the full
pre-registered bar, and a reach-only slice never re-opens it.

**2026-09-27 18:1xZ (RETRO-20260927-1815): scheduled-close crypto
strikes/brackets are a SEPARATE family from touch, and my realized-vol
read has lost all three.** `ed46e73085f3` (BTC $76-78k Sep 12, own 0.53 vs
mid 0.945), `4a1df602fb13` (ETH $2.5-2.6k Sep 12, own 0.55 vs 0.705) and
`a10c93456a38` (BTC above $84k Sep 27, own 0.60 vs 0.745) all settled
Yes; the market was closer on 3 of 3 (row dBrier +0.35 / +0.11 / +0.10).
Common cause, not variance: each time my sd came from a realized-vol
window (7d hourly, or read noise) that was wider than the sd the sibling
ladder implied, and a wider sd pulls a near-the-money favorite toward
0.5. On `a10c93456a38` the note already had the answer: siblings implied
sd ~0.9% (vs my 1.63%), and the 24h vol gave 0.76. **Rule:** on a
scheduled-close crypto strike or bracket that has a sibling ladder, the
recorded est uses the ladder-implied sd unless a dated, sourced catalyst
inside the window (CPI, FOMC, listing, unlock) justifies a wider one;
the realized-vol read goes in the note as a sensitivity. Forecast-only
stands (n=3, and matching the ladder cannot beat it). Re-grade at n=8.

Excluded per the sub-boundary taxonomy (DEEP-2026-08-15): Zambia
(fa185b55a5c3, edge 0.06) and Musk wk 200-219 (7808b6f5a4ef, edge 0.045)
both settled this tick too, but both carry claimed edges ≤0.10 under a
blanket category bar (elections; social-media-postcount respectively) —
the bar, not the numeric veto, is the operative decline reason, so they
grade their category narratives (§Extension to general elections; the
bootstrap fork below), not this ledger. Same treatment already applied to
140-159 (70331099597c) and the still-open 160-179 (c24926a5c9d7). Same
exclusion again 2026-08-21: this week's Musk wk 260-279 (42dc4279d3b9,
edge 0.05, category-bar) settled LOST but is off-ledger for the same
reason — the blanket bar, not the veto, is what declined it. Excluded
again 2026-08-26 (RETRO-20260826-0528): WI Hong 10-15% (03901079bd63) —
est (0.090) sits on the market mid (0.089), and the fill-price check shows
negative edge both sides (Yes 0.090−0.107=−0.017; No 0.910−0.929=−0.019),
so there is no realizable disagreement at all, not merely one under the
0.10 bar — same non-trade treatment as the PPI 5.4%/≥6.0% rows.

**2026-08-26 update (05:28Z settlement): six-row Wisconsin Hong
margin-of-victory bracket batch settled, all No (Hong lost the primary
outright).** 3W (No side, small longshot-payout profits: +0.08+0.09+0.25 =
+0.42u) / 3L (Yes side, all −1.00u) — a clean, uncorrelated confirmation of
the existing pattern: every Yes-side disagreement in this batch lost,
every No-side disagreement won. **Totals now 30 realizable trades, 11W/19L,
net −12.00u**; side split re-summed row-by-row over the full table:
**Yes-side 1W/12L, −10.50u** (three new losses, no new wins — extends the
Yes-side lifetime record to 1-for-13); **No-side 10W/7L, −1.50u** (three
new wins — the No-side hit rate is now a genuine majority, 59%, even
though the side stays net-negative in dollars because longshot-No fills
pay little on a win and the earlier No-side losses were larger stakes at
worse prices). Check: −10.50 + −1.50 = −12.00 ✓. No playbook rule change
from this row alone (see RETRO-20260826-0528) — the widened Yes-side split
is flagged for the next deep retro's Yes/No-side asymmetry discussion, not
acted on here.

**2026-08-26 update (17:12Z settlement): Kuala Lumpur 30C weather row
added, first settled row from the new weather category (exploration
budget, DEEP-2026-08-25 22:xxZ); Beijing 26C sibling settled the same tick
but is EXCLUDED from this table — est 0.23 vs ask 0.23/bid 0.21 leaves no
realizable edge either side (Yes: 0.23−0.23=0.00; No: 0.21−0.23=−0.02),
same non-trade treatment as WI Hong 10-15%.** KL: est 0.26 (Yes) vs ask
0.079, edge +0.181, actual high was NOT 30C → Yes lost, −1.00u. The
directional read matters more than the single row: the market priced the
30C bucket at just 0.073 against my model's 0.26-0.28 (implied warmer
actual than my open-meteo N(30.65,1.2) mean), and the market was right —
supports hypothesis (a) from the exploration-budget note (my model reads
systematically cool / too-coarse), not hypothesis (b) (thin-market
mispricing). Beijing, the one city where my model and the market had
already agreed almost exactly (0.228 vs 0.22), losing on its minority
bucket is uninformative either way. Totals at that point: 31 realizable
trades, 11W/20L, net −13.00u; Yes-side 1W/13L −11.50u; No-side 10W/7L
−1.50u. New generation class: weather Gaussian (self-modeled sd,
unvalidated) 0W/1L −1.00u.

**2026-08-26 update (23:19Z settlement): Amsterdam 25C weather row added —
the other open row from this batch (the Spider-Man BND sibling settles
separately, not part of the weather-Gaussian class).** No side, est 0.87 vs
ask 0.56 (edge +0.31), actual result No (25C did NOT occur) → **won**, CF
P&L +0.79u. This is NOT a same-direction replicate of KL — see the
exploration-budget section above for the correction (Amsterdam's market
mode, 25C, was *below* the model's mean, opposite of KL where the market's
mode was *above* — the two rows disagree, not confirm each other, and no
category verdict follows from this n=2). **Totals now 32 realizable
trades, 12W/20L, net −12.21u**; side split re-summed row-by-row over the
full table: **Yes-side unchanged 1W/13L, −11.50u**; **No-side 11W/7L,
−0.71u** (one new win, +0.79u vs the prior −1.50u). Check: −11.50 + −0.71 =
−12.21 ✓. Weather-Gaussian generation class now 1W/1L, net −0.21u (was
0W/1L, −1.00u).

**2026-08-27 update (DEEP retro): six rows added that the hourly cycles
settled but never entered — Crowley (07:28Z, no retro written), the three
PCE MoM legs (15:21Z retro graded them but skipped the same-commit table
duty), and the BoK pair (04:13Z, logged "at-market/veto-correct" with no
retro when the vetoed read had in fact WON — see reconcile.py check 5,
welded off the back of exactly these three misses).** Row notes:
Crowley is the day's ugliest row — the same single-poll margin model that
generated the Hong brackets put 0.0012 on the man who actually won the
primary at a market 0.032; the No-side fill edge (+0.011) was tiny but
positive, so it enters as a No-side LOSS, a reminder that the No side of a
bad model is still the bad model. PCE MoM 0.2% (+0.014 edge) is effectively
at-market and enters only for convention's consistency (any positive
fill-price edge enters; the WI 15-20% row at +0.023 set the floor).
The BoK pair is ONE underlying decision (complementary books, same
convention as the Musk 2-day and Japan GDP pairs — both rows enter the
table, ONE independent event for any evidence-counting): the analyst-poll
Gaussian-free read (est hike 0.60 vs market 0.32, recorded five days
early) was RIGHT against a confident market, the largest counterfactual
win this ledger has ever recorded (+2.03/+2.13u on the two legs of the one
trade). score.py buckets the pair under `revised_away` (both legs were
superseded to market-agrees rows at 01:25Z after live-CLOB convergence,
hours before on-chain settlement) — the supersede was correct hygiene, but
the counterfactual grades the ORIGINAL record-time book, where the edge
was real and realizable.

**Totals now 38 realizable trades, 16W/22L, net −9.01u.** Side split
re-summed row-by-row: **Yes-side 3W/14L, −9.75u** (adds BoK hike W +2.03,
PCE 0.2% W +0.72, PCE 0.1% L −1.00); **No-side 13W/8L, +0.74u** (adds BoK
hold W +2.13, PCE 0.3% W +0.32, Crowley L −1.00) — the No side crosses
into positive territory for the first time. Check: −9.75 + 0.74 = −9.01 ✓.

**2026-08-28 update (16:18Z, LIGHT tick, RETRO-20260828-1618): UMich
Consumer Sentiment FINAL settled (final print 51.7, in-bracket for
49.0-51.9).** Two outside-view-veto rows enter this table. UMich <49.0
(a5703b36d60a): model P(Yes)=0.334 vs live ask 0.177, Yes side, fill-price
edge +0.157 (est − ask); actual No → **lost, −1.00u**. UMich 49.0-51.9
(fdfd9e781481): model P(Yes)=0.321 vs live bid 0.38, No side (model
favored No since est sits below the bid), fill-price edge = bid − est =
0.38−0.321 = +0.059; actual Yes (the final print landed in this exact
bracket) → the No side **lost, −1.00u** — the veto correctly avoided this
loss, same shape as the BTC touch-$80k and Japan GDP-veto precedents. The
sibling 55.0-57.9 row (81af56a9a430, wide-spread-veto) is EXCLUDED, not
entered: fill-price check both sides negative (Yes: 0.087−0.14=−0.053; No:
(1−0.087)−(1−0.04)=0.913−0.96=−0.047) — est sits inside the bid/ask
spread, no realizable disagreement either side, same non-trade treatment
as WI Hong 10-15% and the PPI 5.4%/≥6.0% rows. The other four UMich
brackets (6e1ba0c74bf2, a1f502906022, 3e269764b9e6, d5dcc12cdabe) settled
no-edge, not entered per the standing rule. **Totals now 40 realizable
trades, 16W/24L, net −11.01u.** Side split re-summed row-by-row over the
full table: **Yes-side 3W/15L, −10.75u** (adds UMich <49.0 L −1.00);
**No-side 13W/9L, −0.26u** (adds UMich 49.0-51.9 L −1.00, pulling the No
side back to net-negative after one tick at +0.74u). Check: −10.75 + −0.26
= −11.01 ✓.

**Mechanical-econ fork bookkeeping correction (same tick):** the Canada
GDP set (6 rows, ab9d001c5d8a/834d675fc7e8/c6803f47d674/e2bbfd112771/
6b02ffb04b9a market-agrees, fe954ed9f325 excluded as a pre-registered
process error) also settled this tick — **every row was market-agrees;
none crossed the >0.10 outside-view boundary, so the veto never fired and
the print contributes ZERO rows to this counterfactual ledger.** This
contradicts the Aug 17 fork pre-registration's framing of Canada GDP as
automatically "a fourth event" — a settled mechanical-econ print with no
disagreement is not a veto-boundary test at all, it's simply an instance
where the self-model and the market agreed. The two UMich veto rows added
above ARE a new independent mechanical-econ-Gaussian veto event (net
−2.00u, 0/2 on this print) but were never named in the original Aug 17
fork queue (only PCE, BoK, and Canada GDP were). Net effect: the fork
still has exactly 3 named-and-fired events (Japan GDP, PCE, BoK, net
+2.92u, 3/3 dBrier) plus one unplanned fourth (UMich, net −2.00u, 0/1
dBrier this print) — the deep retro due DEEP-2026-08-28/29 must decide
with this corrected picture, not the "Canada GDP adds a fourth event"
assumption baked into the original registration. Not acting on the fork
here per the standing rule (hourly cycles extend the table, do not decide
it).

**The Yes/No asymmetry discussion RETRO-20260826-0528 flagged for this
deep retro, resolved: the asymmetry is a CLASS effect wearing a side
costume.** Before today the split read Yes 1W/13L vs No 11W/7L, which
tempts a side rule ("stop trusting Yes-side disagreements"). Today's two
Yes-side wins (BoK hike, PCE modal bucket) are both mechanical-econ rows
with named external benchmarks, and the historical Yes-side graveyard
(Musk brackets, TI, box-office, WI Hong upside legs) is almost entirely
behavioral self-models — the side was proxying for the generation class.
No side rule is written; the mechanical-vs-behavioral carve-out fork
(below) is the correct instrument, and it already exists with a
pre-registered decision date.

**Mechanical-econ fork running tally (decision due DEEP-2026-08-28/29 as
pre-registered — NOT today; Canada GDP settles Aug 28 and adds a fourth
event):** Japan GDP +0.85u (agent ahead on dBrier), PCE MoM +0.04u net
across the three legs of one print (agent ahead, 0.244 vs 0.264 summed
Brier), BoK +2.03u counting the one trade once (agent ahead, 0.16 vs 0.46
on the hike leg). Three independent settled events, net **+2.92u**, agent
ahead on dBrier in 3/3 — the fork's ≥3-events / net-positive / dBrier-
majority condition is currently MET. Tomorrow's deep retro makes the call
with Canada GDP in hand; firing it a day early on the strongest print in
the sample (BoK, hours old) is exactly the hot-streak overreaction the
pre-registration exists to prevent.

**FORK DECIDED — DEEP-2026-08-28.** Corrected inputs at decision time:
Canada GDP contributed ZERO fork events (no veto fired — every row
market-agrees, per the Aug-28 bookkeeping correction above), and UMich
fired as an unplanned fourth event at −2.00u, agent behind on dBrier
(0/2 rows). Tally: including UMich 4 events net +0.92u dBrier 3/4;
excluding it 3 events +2.92u 3/3. The pre-registered condition (≥3
events, net counterfactual > 0, dBrier majority) is met on BOTH
readings, so the carve-out fires as registered. UMich shapes the gate
rather than blocking the decision: its Gaussian was self-built off the
prelim with a property-2 failure recorded at forecast time (no reachable
variance benchmark) — a self-model in econ clothing, exactly what the
registered candidate shape ("named external survey benchmark") already
excluded. See §Mechanical-econ carve-out below for the enacted rule and
its kill switch.

**2026-09-04 update (16:13Z, FULL cycle, RETRO-20260904-1613): four
Aug23-vintage NFP bracket rows settled (superseded by the Sep4 revision,
graded on their record-time book per standing convention). Actual print:
NFP >= 150k jobs added (a large beat).**

| Row | est vs mkt | Side | Realizable edge | Result | CF P&L |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| NFP add 0-50k (d2c8054e1df6) | 0.1794 / 0.265 | No | +0.071 | No | **+0.33** |
| NFP add 50-100k (7800470f6fab) | 0.218 / 0.315 | No | +0.082 | No | **+0.43** |
| NFP add 100-150k (adc70585857a) | 0.1963 / 0.141 | Yes | +0.055 | No | −1.00 |
| NFP add >=150k (a8a368a644f4) | 0.2266 / 0.145 | Yes | +0.082 | **Yes** | **+6.14** |

Net this batch: **+5.90u** (3W/1L). **Totals now 93 realizable trades,
46W/47L, net +21.29u.** Side split re-summed row-by-row: **Yes-side
4W/21L, −10.61u** (adds 100-150k L, >=150k W); **No-side 42W/26L,
+31.90u** (adds 0-50k W, 50-100k W). Check: −10.61 + 31.90 = 21.29 ✓.
Ruling: the veto correctly avoided three losing legs, but the >=150k leg
it also declined would have been the single largest win in this table —
the batch nets positive only because that leg happened to hit, which is
outcome luck on a >0.10 disagreement, not method vindication (full
grading in RETRO-20260904-1613, which also covers the two standard-floor
bets on the same print).

**2026-09-04 update (18:13Z, LIGHT tick, RETRO-20260904-1813): one
same-day weather row settled.**

| Row | est vs mkt | Side | Realizable edge | Result | CF P&L |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Shanghai 31C weather (6aff2db6ddbe) | 0.58 / 0.885 | No | +0.280 | Yes | −1.00 |

**Totals now 94 realizable trades, 46W/48L, net +20.29u.** Side split
re-summed row-by-row: **Yes-side unchanged 4W/21L, −10.61u**; **No-side
42W/27L, +30.90u** (adds this loss). Check: −10.61 + 30.90 = 20.29 ✓.
Ruling: model was directionally right (est 0.58 > 0.5) but less
confident than the market's 0.885 given the same partial-day data —
the relative-value No side lost; weather stays no-bet, no gate change
at n=1 (full grading in RETRO-20260904-1813).

**2026-09-04 update (22:11Z, LIGHT tick, RETRO-20260904-2215): five
Astra by-date rows settled, all No-side, all LOST — the family's first
losses ever (previously 5W/0L, by-Sep2 + the by/on-Sep3 batch above).**

| Row | est vs mkt | Side | Realizable edge | Result | CF P&L |

that does NOT match the `best_bid_at_record`/`best_ask_at_record` those
same forecast.py calls actually stamped (0.863/0.685/0.64) — the live
book had already repriced 50+ points same-day and the note never
reflected it; graded against the true recorded book the "modest" declined
edges were actually 0.36–0.78. The other two rows (by-Sep7, by-Sep15)
quoted the price correctly and still lost — clean misses, gate worked as
designed, zero capital risked on any of the five. Full grading and the

**Accounting convention (DEEP-2026-09-05, per operator note 2026-09-04
~23:20Z): `python3 core/counterfactual.py ledger` is the record; this
hand table is the narrative.** Every future retro that extends this
table also quotes the mechanical ledger's outside-view-veto line
(currently: 106 CF trades, 46W/60L, +$82.17 ≙ +16.4u, brier_delta
+0.0280, held-out +$111.17). The hand table reads +11.29u on 103 trades
because 8 of its rows are trades the protected caps would refuse
(entries ≥0.96 or no bid at record) and some older rows grade edge
against the mid instead of the fill; when the two disagree, the
mechanical ledger wins. Interpretation stays the operator's gnhf-run-4
verdict: the positive CF P&L is one family (Astra snapshots, +34u of
the total; without it the vetoed trades lose), the vetoed beliefs are
worse-calibrated than the market (+0.028), the veto stays.

**2026-09-05 update (14:12Z resolve.py, LIGHT tick; two `wide-spread-veto`
forecasts settled — first wide-spread-veto batch to enter this table
since the Aug14 correction.** Both rows are the same LCK UBF Gen.G vs
Hanwha Life Esports Bo5 (decided 3-1, 4 games total), researched and
vetoed together at 2026-09-02T12:46:38Z. Both legs' directional read was
correct (Over on O/U3.5, Under on O/U4.5), but the mechanical fill
arithmetic uses each row's own recorded `best_ask_at_record` (0.77 and
0.39 respectively), not the book snapshot quoted in the O/U3.5 note
(ask 0.39, implying an apparent +0.26 edge) — the two don't match, a
one-off timing/recording gap between the manual spread-check and
forecast.py's own capture, not yet a pattern (n=1, watch for recurrence
before proposing anything).

10.59 ✓. Both legs' realizable edge is negative against the recorded ask
despite the directional read being right on both — the wide-spread
veto's arithmetic justification (crossing the spread erases the apparent
edge) holds even on a batch where the underlying model call was correct.
Ruling: no boundary change at n=2, consistent with the Aug14 correction's
"get the arithmetic right, not a narrative verdict" instruction. Full
grading in RETRO-20260905-1412. Mechanical ledger's wide-spread-veto line

Model (0.26) leaned Yes slightly more than the market mid (0.23); the
realizable counterfactual enters Yes at the 0.25 ask (edge +0.01,
essentially at-market — this was never a real disagreement, just noise
around a near-consensus number). Outcome was No, so the tiny counterfactual
Yes-side edge lost, −1.00u. Per the 2026-09-06 ~00:30Z operator note, this

same-day weather subclass is now 5 rows, 1W/4L, −17.65 (was 4 rows,
1W/3L, −12.65): this row is a fourth avoided loss (Shanghai, Munich,
Miami, and now Wellington all had their declined side lose), against
Guangzhou as the one case where the veto missed a win. A fixed-sd
same-day point-forecast Gaussian is still net-negative on this exact

keeping the veto rather than loosening it — this row reinforces the

read that yes-side vetoes are the worse-performing class (9W/25L at
~26% win rate vs no-side's 39W/39L at 50%); occasional large yes-side
misses like this one are the expected cost of holding that boundary, not
new evidence to loosen it. The Tokyo row extends the same-day-weather

[MERGE NOTE, operator reconcile 2026-09-07 ~21:00Z: the operator-machine
loop graded the same three rows (Wellington, SPD >=9%, Tokyo) in parallel

above are canonical and its duplicate rows are not carried. Two distinct
rulings from the operator-machine retros (RETRO-20260907-1241, -1613) are
carried here as pre-registered, not enacted: (a) Wellington -- the mean was
right and the dispersion wrong; a same-day point forecast sitting ON a
bucket boundary makes P(bucket) ~0.45 by construction, and the market's
0.815 (implied sd ~0.35 after noon) read the afternoon peak better; test
the after-noon sd (0.6 vs ~0.35) once the same-day subclass reaches ~6
settled rows. (b) SPD >=9% and the Gruene >=7% bet WON are one event: the
self-chosen sd (1.2-1.3) for sub-10% parties in this Landtag election was
too tight and the miss was upward; at the next German state election,
grade the small-party vote-share Gaussian rows against a wider,
upward-skewed error before the category is allowed a >0.10 disagreement.]

Ruling: no boundary change at n=1 — this row is well outside the
same-day-weather subclass's usual afternoon-peak-boundary failure shape
(a pre-dawn forecast on a wide 3°C-out bucket, not a near-boundary same-day

veto correctly avoiding the tail loss elsewhere in the weather category
(still net −$48.60 in the mechanical ledger) rather than evidence to
loosen it.

Wellington, RETRO-20260907-1241's pre-registered sd question): the
Gaussian's sd, not its center, produced the disagreement, and the market
priced the same point forecast with a tighter sd and won. It counts
toward the pre-registered Wellington sd test (re-examine the weather sd
once the same-day subclass reaches ~6 settled rows — this row is
next-day-style, so it informs but does not trigger that test). Within

`econ-cpi` veto forecasts settled on the China Aug 2026 CPI print — one
`outside-view-veto`, one `wide-spread-veto` fillable, one
`wide-spread-veto` refused as unexecutable).** NBS printed China Aug 2026
CPI YoY at 0.8%, in the 0.7-0.8% bracket. The base-effect anchor used at
record time (Jul YoY 0.5% + Aug seasonal MoM ~+0.3% → ~0.8%) was exact —
first confirmed application of the PPI base-effect projection method
(§"PPI YoY brackets: base-effect projection", 2026-08-11 above) to a
second economic series. Two consensus sources disagreed by one bracket at
record time (tradingeconomics 0.7% vs investing.com/Lundgreen 0.9%); TE's
figure fell in the actual bracket, Lundgreen/investing.com's did not —
n=1, too weak to rule on for future disputes, but the first data point
favors TE when the two conflict.

- **0.7-0.8% bracket** (`19cf14c87979`, outside-view-veto): mixture model
  P=0.33 vs mid 0.485; the No-side apparent edge (~0.15) was built on the
  contradictory consensus and vetoed under gate 2. Settled Yes — the
  declined No bet would have LOST. Correct veto.
- **≥0.9% bracket** (`7bacc91ddf91`, wide-spread-veto): own P=0.38 vs ask
  0.305, spread 0.069 > max_spread 0.06. Settled No — the declined Yes
  bet would have LOST. Correct veto.
- **0.5-0.6% bracket, post-print supersede** (`9eff80f25296`,
  wide-spread-veto): after the print, Yes ask 0.22 was mispriced (true
  edge ~0.20 on No) but the No side had zero asks in the live book (bids
  only) — refused by the fill model as unexecutable, correctly excluded
  from the counterfactual trade count, not a real declined trade.

| Row | est vs mkt | Side | Realizable edge | Result | CF P&L |

Net this batch: **−2.00u** (0W/2L). Current mechanical ledgers
(`core/counterfactual.py ledger --skip-reason <reason>`, both include
these rows):
- outside-view-veto: 123 settled declined forecasts, 115 fillable CF
  trades, 49W/66L, pnl +$106.29 ≙ +21.26u, brier_delta +0.0301, held-out
  +$136.68 (was 122/114/49W-65L/+$111.29/+$141.68 before this row). Side
  split: yes 34 rows/34 trd/9W-25L/+$20.82 (unchanged this batch); no 89
  rows/81 trd/40W-41L/+$85.47 (adds this row's 0W/1L, −$5.00). Check:
  20.82+85.47=106.29 ✓.
- wide-spread-veto: 6 settled declined forecasts, 4 fillable CF trades,

  refused `9eff80f25296` which contributes a settled row but no trade).
  Check: −2.82−5.00=−7.82 ✓.

Ruling: no boundary change at n=2 on either gate — both counterfactual
trades would have lost, i.e. both declines were correct, consistent with
the standing reads (outside-view-veto's no-side already the stronger
performer at 40W/41L vs yes-side's 9W/25L; wide-spread-veto still thin at
n=6, too small to read). The base-effect method confirmation and the
TE-vs-Lundgreen data point are the more useful findings from this batch
than the veto grading — both are single-instance and carried as
hypotheses, not rules, until a second China CPI print or a second
TE/Lundgreen conflict tests them.

**2026-09-11 update (08:1xZ resolve.py, LIGHT tick, cloud; RETRO-20260911-0814;
3 more `wide-spread-veto` rows settled — one this tick, two backlog
catch-ups found while reconciling the tool's live total against this
table's last snapshot, both missed by earlier ticks):**

| Row | est vs mkt | Side | Realizable edge | Result | CF P&L |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chewy "Consumable" wide-spread duplicate (`e7a452fef1be`) | 0.93 / 0.59 | Yes | +0.340 | Yes | **+3.47** |
| RNC "2028/Campaign" (`906a1a65abc8`) | 0.80 / 0.71 | Yes | +0.090 | Yes | **+2.04** |
| RNC "Tax on Tips/Overtime" (`83321f868e0f`) | 0.75 / 0.77 | Yes | −0.020 | Yes | **+1.49** |

`e7a452fef1be` settled 2026-09-09T14:23:30Z but was never entered here:
it's the original 0.93-est Chewy forecast, superseded two minutes after
recording by `ffc3fcdcbaa6` when the label was corrected to
`outside-view-veto` (that row is already graded above at line ~3444).
`core/counterfactual.py` deliberately keeps superseded rows rather than
dropping them, so this is a legitimate second row under
`wide-spread-veto`, distinct from its already-graded successor — just
never manually added. `906a1a65abc8` settled 2026-09-11T07:23:43Z but
the 07:28:35Z TRIGGERED cycle that should have graded it (settlement
duty applies to TRIGGERED cycles same as any other, per
RETRO-20260908-2250) only logged its Sweden Liberals research and
reported "settled 0" — a miss, caught up here one tick late.
`83321f868e0f` is this tick's own genuine new settlement.

Current mechanical ledger's wide-spread-veto line (`core/counterfactual.py

held-out −$1.50 (was 6/4/2 refused/2W-2L/−$7.82/−0.0326/−$8.51 before
this batch). Side split: yes 6 rows/6 trd/5W-1L/+$4.19 (adds all three
new wins, +$7.00, was 3/3/2W-1L/−$2.82 before this batch); no 3 rows/1

−2.82+3.47+2.04+1.49=4.18≈4.19 (rounding) ✓.

Ruling: no boundary change at n=9/7 trades — all three new rows are
declined-Yes-side wins, extending the yes-side's edge but still far
short of the ~15-settlement floor. `vance-mention` as a category: n=2,
both won, +$3.54 — both are broad, near-default politician phrases
("campaign", Vance's own stock "tax on tips/overtime" line) rather than
narrow session-specific content, consistent with the broad-phrase side
of the say-the-word split RETRO-20260911-0624 already documented; adds
weak supporting evidence, not a new finding.

**2026-09-15 12:5xZ update (LIGHT tick, operator machine, resolve.py; 1
`wide-spread-veto` forecast settled, plus a catch-up row).** `705c1219decd`
is this tick's genuine settlement: F1 Italian GP safety car (raced Sep6,
market end date Sep13), a fact-final row where the F1.com race report
confirmed a physical Safety Car on lap 2. Declined because the spread
(0.099) exceeded max_spread 0.06. `697a7f4f3799` (Emmys, Last Week
Tonight) settled 2026-09-15T04:13Z and was graded narratively in
RETRO-20260915-0414, but that commit did not extend this table - a
violation of the 2026-08-23 same-commit rule, repaired here.

−0.25−5.00=−5.25 ✓; 4.19−5.00+0.56=−0.25 ✓.

Ruling: no boundary change at n=11/9 trades. The fact-finality subclass
is now 4 trades, 3W/1L, +$0.65: the veto costs little on fact-final rows
because a 0.90 ask leaves only ~$0.56 to win on a $5 stake, so a tight
spread gate there forgoes small, near-certain gains rather than large
ones. The −$5.00 Emmys row is a thin-edge (+0.05) judgment row the veto
correctly kept out.

right); see the outside-view-veto section below for the cross-family

(recorded 2026-09-08 20:21Z, superseding `e7a452fef1be` two minutes
earlier as a label erratum — same 0.93 estimate, reclassified from
`wide-spread-veto` because DEEP-2026-08-14's tiebreak routes a
>0.10-claimed-edge row to outside-view-veto even when the spread gate
also fires): Chewy fiscal Q2 2026 earnings call, own est 0.93 vs ask
0.58 (mid 0.34, an empty-book artifact — bid was 0.10), on the evidence
that "Consumables" is Chewy's own reported revenue segment name, used
5-6 times in the prior-year Q2 transcript. Settled **Yes** — the
declined Yes-side counterfactual trade **wins**. Grading the three
questions the watch item pre-registered: (a) the tool's own subclass
tagger filed this row under `fact-finality`, not unlabelled judgment —
independent, mechanical support for treating "company repeats its own
standard reported vocabulary" as closer to a mechanical base rate than
a behavioural self-model, though n=1 is too thin to act on; (b) the
blind mech (`superforcaster-market-aware`, service 44) gave 0.92 —
within 0.01 of the own estimate — while self-classing the question
`NR-utterance`/`researchability=0.15`, i.e. confidently right on a
question it flagged as unresearchable, the same pattern the still-open
Vance utterance rows show; (c) the 40-share ask at 0.58 was in fact
takeable at the strategy's $5 (~8.6-share) stake size, so the
wide-spread veto alone would have been overcautious here — the correct
blocker was the outside-view veto's >0.10 boundary, which this row does
not argue against. Full narrative in RETRO-20260909-1425.

no 89 rows/81 trd/40W-41L/+$85.47 (unchanged this batch).
Check: 28.96+85.47=114.43 ✓. The subclass reading stays uncomfortable
in the honest direction: fact-finality is now n=29 labeled rows at CF
pnl +$122.08 but subclass dBrier +0.0419 — the wins are real money and
still worse-than-market beliefs on average; the fork bar below, not
this table, decides anything.

Ruling: no boundary change at n=1 within say-the-word (the category
verdict threshold is ~15 settlements) and no change to the relaxation
fork's status — overall brier_delta is still positive (+0.0264, agent
behind market) and this single win doesn't reach the fork's per-fold
recompute threshold on its own. The useful finding is the (a)/(b)/(c)
grading above, carried as a baseline for the still-open Vance utterance
rows (`83321f868e0f`, `906a1a65abc8`) rather than a rule change yet.

so the >0.10 veto again saved money on this event family (now 2 wins /
2 losses for the same-event Sep10 RNC utterance batch: MAGA and Radical
Left won, Endorse and America First lost). The same-session bet

refuting the veto boundary at this n — same "confident middle, thin
tails" shape noted elsewhere in this ledger for point-estimate Gaussians
on a single transcript. Mechanical ledger is the record going forward
(`core/counterfactual.py ledger --skip-reason outside-view-veto` /
`--skip-reason wide-spread-veto`); this table entry satisfies the
per-row documentation duty (reconcile.py check 5) without re-deriving
the running hand totals, per the 2026-09-06 operator note above that
this file's totals are narrative only.

the exact violation shape the schedule.json `_comment` rule (DEEP-2026-08-23,

of the same already-graded Sweden Liberals event (consistent with its
settled bet `b063db346052`, all No-side declines lost together), and the
BoE row is a clean confirmation that a discretionary MPC vote reads like
the self-model veto class, not a special case: the market (and the
Reuters poll it tracked) beat both the own estimate and the weaker LSEG/

no boundary change - a 0.04 edge was never a veto-sized disagreement, and
the row is on this ledger only because of its label (same treatment as
`9618a7d0872d`). The label and the input both broke the touch-family
ruling above (DEEP-2026-09-01): touch rows are `unvalidated-method`, and
4 of the 6 modeled crypto touch rows recorded since that ruling
(`dde658c37455`, `61bc26d805b6`, `a28637cb4026`, `8d1eb46b7c32`) used a
guessed or swept vol. From this commit every touch estimate comes from
`strategy/tools/touch.py`, which refuses to run without a named, dated
`--vol-source`; the forecast note quotes its output. Settled measured-vol
rows stand at 3 of the 6 the re-grade needs (`edd6af85d6a6`,

sd judgment parameter"): the >=31% row's point estimate (0.81) sat on the
correct side of 0.5 but the veto declined the market-implied No edge
that the loose-sd tail created, and that declined No trade lost because
SPD did clear 31%. The 28-31% sibling declined a Yes-side edge built on
the same Gaussian and also lost, since the outcome landed in the >=31%

right, the self-built Gaussian tails were not) — consistent with this

`fact-finality` even though the note explicitly argues this is a
self-modeled Gaussian bucket, not a fact-final case — a labeling
mismatch worth a future reconcile pass, not acted on here. The veto
declined this exact class (behavioral point-estimate Gaussian, sd

Ruling: no boundary change at n=2, both wins. Snapshot 2's own estimate
(0.68) was the weaker of the pair — it leaned toward Yes on an unsourced
book jump the row's own note admits it "cannot see behind" — but the veto
still declined the bet on estimate-distrust grounds regardless of
direction, and the declined No-side trade won anyway because the market
itself never fully priced the leak in either (No-side edge stayed
positive, just thinner: +0.324 at snapshot 1 down to +0.091 at snapshot
2). The veto is doing its job independent of estimate quality here; the

inside that subclass's noise. The Yes-side row is the more interesting
one: the veto correctly followed its own rule (signing not yet an
immutable fact at research time) on a trade that would have paid
(edge 0.15, and it won) — the known, already-quantified cost of keeping

8W-5L/-$7.99/-0.0684/-$3.67 before the two No-side additions; the
Lowe's row's pnl was always inside these totals — settled over a month

counted here).

Ruling: no boundary change at n=3 across two unrelated events plus one
documentation-only backfill. The Lowe's row is the interesting one on
method, not P&L: the "modest apparent edge" the original research
quoted was against the market's *mid* (0.595); the mechanical ledger
fills at the actual best ask (0.88) on an incoherent, spread-blown book,
which turns the same row negative (-0.260) — the veto's own reasoning
("if this is genuine live news the architecture cannot win the race
anyway") was right for a reason beyond the spread-gate mechanics: the
apparent edge was a mid-price illusion. It won on Yes anyway (small,
+$0.68, priced by the bad ask it would have had to pay), which is a
lucky fill outcome, not evidence the mid-based edge was ever real.

a real edge on a small-n base rate that keeps paying off, but n=2 same-day

Units note for future reconcile reads (DEEP-2026-09-23): per-row CF P&L
in this section's tables is DOLLARS at the $5 flat stake; `reconcile`
prints per-row pnl in 1u = pnl/5 units, so a hand `-5.00` against a
ledger `-1.00u` is the SAME number, not a diff. Of the 71 "C. rows in
both that differ" in today's reconcile run, ~60 are exactly this units
convention; the residue is (i) early rows whose hand edge was quoted
against the MID rather than the realizable ask (Astra 0.783-hand vs
0.056-ledger is the worst; the Lowe's row in the 2026-09-22 REPAIR
documents the same mid-vs-ask illusion), and (ii) rows the fill model
refuses (entry outside [0.02, 0.95] or no bid) where the hand table
recorded a fill anyway. Historical rows are NOT being rewritten to
match — the mechanical ledger is authoritative for every ruling and
gate; the hand table is the narrative index. An operator proposal to
make `reconcile` units-aware and to extend its B-check beyond
outside-view-veto is filed in journal/proposals.md (2026-09-23 pass).

owed to the next session that can run the tools. No boundary change (n=1,
constitution rule 2).

**2026-09-30 07:5xZ update (FULL cycle, operator machine; 10y 5.25 Sep touch
settled Yes: 1 `wide-spread-veto` row, see RETRO-20260930-0750.)**

| Row | est vs mkt | Side | Realizable edge | Result | CF P&L |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10y hit 5.25 in Sep (`a41e6e996b85`) | 0.46 / 0.65 (book 0.44/0.86) | No | -0.020 (own No 0.54 vs No ask 0.56) | Yes | -1.00 (mechanical tool fills it anyway) |

Mechanical totals (`core/counterfactual.py ledger`, 09-30 07:5xZ, $5 flat,
replaces the totals owed since the 09-29 17:4xZ block): outside-view-veto
180 rows / 172 trades / 73W-99L / +$79.87 / dBrier +0.0322 / held-out
+$68.98; wide-spread-veto 28 rows / 25 trades / 14W-11L / -$29.35 / dBrier
-0.0299 / held-out -$25.00. Ruling: no boundary change. The veto blocked no
realizable trade here; the book spread was the whole story.
